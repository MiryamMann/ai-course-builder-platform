# AI Learning Platform ‚Äì Mini MVP

This project is a minimal viable product (MVP) for an AI-driven learning platform, built with a modern full-stack architecture using **Node.js**, **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**. The platform supports prompt-based learning and allows users to register, log in, and submit prompts to an AI model for responses.
